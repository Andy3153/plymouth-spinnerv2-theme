# Spinner v2 Plymouth theme

This is a Plymouth theme loosely based on the default BGRT theme, with custom password entry prompt, custom spinner and the NixOS logo at the bottom.

## Exporting the elements for yourself from the SVG
- open src/src.svg in Inkscape
- `Ctrl+Shift+L` to open layers menu
- open layer folder `orig` and click on an element name which you want to export (we use the original spinner theme PNGs as borders to export things in the same sizes)
- `Ctrl+Shift+E` to open export menu
- use `Selection` export method
- (maybe) increase DPI to 300
- export
